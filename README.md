# complementarity_estimation

This repo presents codes related to manuscript "Uncovering and estimating complementarity in
urban lives"

We use Python codes to present the following rationale:
- `encode_venue_to_geohash.py`: encode each venue into geohash for easier simulation later.
- `simulation.py`: simulation of movements based on encoded geohash.
- `gnn.ipynb`: build the graph neural network.

We provide the preview of some key data in `sample_data.ipynb`.
